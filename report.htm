	<h1>Daily Progress Report</h1>
	<div class="separator"></div>

	<h2>December 12th 2016</h2>
	<p>Today I created this daily report page for me to track my progress towards getting a web dev job. My hope is for this page to keep me more honest with myself and subsequently more productive and focused.</p>
	<p>I also FINALLY upgraded my hostgator account from a hatchling plan to a baby plan which adds unlimited domains to my account for only $1 a month extra. Last time I spent roughly an hour trying to figure out how to do that, this time it only took me a few minutes. It's funny how sometimes things are easy and sometimes hard. In other news, hostgators website is hard to navigate.</p>
