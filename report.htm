	<h2>December 14th 2016</h2>
	<p>Today was a rough day. I spent most of my productive time shopping for a new car and doing last minute Christmas shopping. After that, Roach and I took Jason to his doc appointment. By the time I got home I was wiped. I should have taken a nap but I tried to push through and kept falling asleep at my desk. I normally would have gone out and bought an energy drink but… no car. On top of all that, I'm still sick. I feel ashamed for wasting all that valuable time, and I feel like I'm making excuses, but maybe some of them are legitimate. I could have done more, for sure though. I did watch a few Lynda videos, but didn’t really learn anything useful.</p>

	<p>I did nothing useful today because I have all tomorrow off. I know, that’s no excuse, I should have done at least SOMETHING.</p>

	<h2>December 12th 2016</h2>
	<p>Today I created this daily report page for me to track my progress towards getting a web dev job. My hope is for this page to keep me more honest with myself and subsequently more productive and focused.</p>
	<p>I also FINALLY upgraded my hostgator account from a hatchling plan to a baby plan which adds unlimited domains to my account for only $1 a month extra. Last time I spent roughly an hour trying to figure out how to do that, this time it only took me a few minutes. It's funny how sometimes things are easy and sometimes hard. In other news, hostgators website is hard to navigate.</p>
